	* Looking to develope a wibesite which will connect village people. It will be a survey based website. Users will provide their
	 opinion about farming like: for which crop they are looking this seasion, what may be price breakups.
	 website will have provision to provide information about how much farmable field they are having (should be kept confidential)
	and also should keep data that which crop is in what percentage in village so that we can analysis future production and rates 
	 with the help of previous datas
